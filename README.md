## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS selectors more effectively. I used the GRID system and I had to remove the border from the last two elements and for that I had to use the nth-last-child selector as follows.

```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-row-gap: 16px;

  & > div {
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--stone-150);
  }

  & > div:nth-last-child(-n + 2) {
    border-bottom: none;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I need to know more about CSS selectors and how to do styling in a more advanced way.
